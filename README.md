Trying to implement the right tools to be faster on my patching.

25/11 
- added a tanh at the output stage of my "soft membrane"
- kinda found a "constant volume trick" when you modify the resonance of the reson~ filter in the soft membrane
- copied the Emilie Gillet svf in a nameless gen~ patcher. seems safer.
