the Matt_Modules.maxpat patcher contains all the modules nicely presented and ready to copy and paste.


09/12
- dusty kick
- audio looper added (think ambient looper, not loopstation like module)

25/11 
- added a tanh at the output stage of my "soft membrane"
- kinda found a "constant volume trick" when you modify the resonance of the reson~ filter in the soft membrane
- copied the Emilie Gillet svf in a nameless gen~ patcher. seems safer.
  I found many gen~ filters implemented here https://github.com/ess-m/gen-filters. great source.
